# AI-Final-Research-Project

Abstract: 
The project was about using PyCaret to cover a large area of the machine learning pipeline such as data ingestion, pre-processing, training models, hyperparameter tuning, prediction, and much more. The basis of using PyCaret was to learn naturally constructed commands which save hundreds of lines of code. In this instance, the focus was a Chess dataset based on King-Rook vs King-Pawn using the Classification task. After comparing the best models, the results were that the Decision Tree Classifier had the highest accuracy among all models, and the Dummy Classifier had the worst performance.
